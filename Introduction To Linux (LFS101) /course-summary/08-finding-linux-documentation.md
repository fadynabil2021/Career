# 08. Finding Linux Documentation

## Learning Objectives

* Locate authoritative documentation: man pages, info, and online resources.
* Use built-in help options and community resources effectively.

## Key Concepts Explained

* **man pages**: concise reference for commands and system calls.
* **GNU Info**: hyperlinked documentation used by some GNU utilities.
* **--help and help**: quick usage hints for commands and shell built-ins.

## Commands & Examples

```bash
# Read man page for ls
man ls

# Search man pages for a keyword
man -k network

# Shell builtin help
help cd
```

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

* Quickly checking flag syntax with `--help` during troubleshooting.
* Researching configuration file options in man pages before editing.

## Common Mistakes & Best Practices

* Mistake: Relying solely on web searches without checking man pages.
* Best practice: Use `man -k` to discover relevant commands and `apropos` for concepts.

## Summary

Documentation is built into Linux—learning to use man, info, and help keeps you productive and reduces guesswork.
