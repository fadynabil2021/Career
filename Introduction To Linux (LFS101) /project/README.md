# Production-Grade Single-Node Linux Workstation & Service Environment

## Overview

This project simulates a production-ready Linux workstation for multi-user access, automation, and security monitoring. It is intended as a portfolio-grade demonstration of foundational and intermediate Linux administration skills, covering all LFS101 concepts.

## Key Features

- Role-based user and group management
- Secure service management via systemd
- Centralized logging and auditing
- Networking setup and diagnostics
- Automation scripts with strict Bash standards
- Security hardening following best practices
- Documentation for maintainability and training purposes

## Target Audience

- Linux beginners to intermediate learners
- Recruiters and hiring managers evaluating system administration skills
- Technical instructors and students for reference

## Repository Structure

- `course-summary/` → Educational theory aligned with LFS101
- `project/` → Implementation, scripts, and validation
- `assets/` → Diagrams and visual assets
- `scripts/` → Production-grade Bash automation scripts
